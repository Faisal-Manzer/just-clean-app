            Justcleanrojgar.in was launched on the 70th Republic Day of India to support employment generation across the country. JustCleanRojgar aims to provide employment opportunities to job-seekers across India and overseas. Our mission is to provide employment to 1 lac people by 2022.
            We already have a strong base in placements with Training Partners of NSDC under PMKVY, PMKK and DDUGKY projects in over 20 states in India. Till date, we have participated in over 100 Rojgar Melas and have hired 15,000+ skilled and unskilled persons under these schemes. We have also organized our own independent Rojgar Melas with the support of State Governments to provide employment.
